## 🧠 About Me

I'm a BCA student with a deep passion for **game development** and **modern web technologies**. Currently, I'm developing FPS style games in Unity 6**, featuring custom player mechanics, intelligent AI bots, and immersive gameplay systems.

On the web side, I enjoy building responsive, fast-loading websites using **React** and **Vite**, with a strong focus on clean UI/UX and reusable components.
